# Data Science Project #002 - Videogame Analysis

A very basic analysis of Video Game sales until about 2014, I think. 
[Artichopper](https://github.com/arctichopper), a friend from college. We both are learning Data Science!

Anyway, in this project I made a analysis of number of games sold according to consoles and publishers using Pandas, and having some visualization with Seaborn.
